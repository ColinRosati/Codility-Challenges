Solution 
	This solution revolves around unique permutation. So using a Set is good to 
	only push unique, and use .has(). The other fact is array always starts with 1.

	So any array could be check against its array.length.

	So there are two cases that you would break the function and retun 0.
	1. if double numbers break
	2. if array element is larger then array.length
				- this wil break if number starts above 1
						ex: [2]
						ex: [2,3]
						ex anything above 1 element containing 1
