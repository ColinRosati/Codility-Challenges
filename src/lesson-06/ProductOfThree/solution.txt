Solution
		I had a few gotchas with this problem. 
			1. I didnt realize you can sort the array I thought it was maxSum of all linear combinations.
			2. multiplying two negatives results in a positive

	The solution is to sort the array. If there are more then 1 negative then you must compare if a double negative is higher maxSum
