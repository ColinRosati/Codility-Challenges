Solution
	The solution comes from accumulating the Zeros on every One instance.

	the totalPairs is the accumulation of zeros . Only accumulate on 1 instance
	totalPairs += totalZero
	[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

	1st loop
		totatZero = 1
		totalPairs = 0
	
	2nd Loop
		totalZero = 1
		totalPairs = 1

	3rd loop
		totalZero = 2
		totalPairs = 1 
	
	4th
		totalZero = 2
		totalPairs = 3

		5th
		totalZero = 2
		totalPairs = 5
